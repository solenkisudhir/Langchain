# SQL | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain
One of the most common types of databases that we can build Q&A systems for are SQL databases. LangChain comes with a number of built-in chains and agents that are compatible with any SQL dialect supported by SQLAlchemy (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Databricks, SQLite). They enable use cases such as:

*   Generating queries that will be run based on natural language questions,
*   Creating chatbots that can answer questions based on database data,
*   Building custom dashboards based on insights a user wants to analyze,

and much more.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building Q&A systems of SQL databases requires executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent‚Äôs needs. This will mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system. For more on general security best practices, [see here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/security/).
