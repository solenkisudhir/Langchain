# Few-shot prompt templates | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain
In this tutorial, we‚Äôll learn how to create a prompt template that uses few-shot examples. A few-shot prompt template can be constructed from either a set of examples, or from an Example Selector object.

### Use Case[‚Äã](#use-case "Direct link to Use Case")

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll configure few-shot examples for self-ask with search.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Create the example set[‚Äã](#create-the-example-set "Direct link to Create the example set")

To get started, create a list of few-shot examples. Each example should be a dictionary with the keys being the input variables and the values being the values for those input variables.

```
from langchain_core.prompts.few_shot import FewShotPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate

examples = [
    {
        "question": "Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?",
        "answer": """
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali
""",
    },
    {
        "question": "When was the founder of craigslist born?",
        "answer": """
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the founder of craigslist?
Intermediate answer: Craigslist was founded by Craig Newmark.
Follow up: When was Craig Newmark born?
Intermediate answer: Craig Newmark was born on December 6, 1952.
So the final answer is: December 6, 1952
""",
    },
    {
        "question": "Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?",
        "answer": """
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
So the final answer is: Joseph Ball
""",
    },
    {
        "question": "Are both the directors of Jaws and Casino Royale from the same country?",
        "answer": """
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who is the director of Jaws?
Intermediate Answer: The director of Jaws is Steven Spielberg.
Follow up: Where is Steven Spielberg from?
Intermediate Answer: The United States.
Follow up: Who is the director of Casino Royale?
Intermediate Answer: The director of Casino Royale is Martin Campbell.
Follow up: Where is Martin Campbell from?

### Create a formatter for the few-shot examples[‚Äã](#create-a-formatter-for-the-few-shot-examples "Direct link to Create a formatter for the few-shot examples")

Configure a formatter that will format the few-shot examples into a string. This formatter should be a `PromptTemplate` object.

```
example_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["question", "answer"], template="Question: {question}\n{answer}"
)

print(example_prompt.format(**examples[0]))

```


```
Question: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali

```


### Feed examples and formatter to `FewShotPromptTemplate`[‚Äã](#feed-examples-and-formatter-to-fewshotprompttemplate "Direct link to feed-examples-and-formatter-to-fewshotprompttemplate")

Finally, create a `FewShotPromptTemplate` object. This object takes in the few-shot examples and the formatter for the few-shot examples.

```
prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    examples=examples,
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    suffix="Question: {input}",
    input_variables=["input"],
)

print(prompt.format(input="Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?"))

```


```
Question: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali


Question: When was the founder of craigslist born?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the founder of craigslist?
Intermediate answer: Craigslist was founded by Craig Newmark.
Follow up: When was Craig Newmark born?
Intermediate answer: Craig Newmark was born on December 6, 1952.
So the final answer is: December 6, 1952

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
So the final answer is: Joseph Ball


Question: Are both the directors of Jaws and Casino Royale from the same country?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who is the director of Jaws?
Intermediate Answer: The director of Jaws is Steven Spielberg.
Follow up: Where is Steven Spielberg from?
Intermediate Answer: The United States.
Follow up: Who is the director of Casino Royale?
Intermediate Answer: The director of Casino Royale is Martin Campbell.
Follow up: Where is Martin Campbell from?
Intermediate Answer: New Zealand.
So the final answer is: No

Using an example selector[‚Äã](#using-an-example-selector "Direct link to Using an example selector")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Feed examples into `ExampleSelector`[‚Äã](#feed-examples-into-exampleselector "Direct link to feed-examples-into-exampleselector")

We will reuse the example set and the formatter from the previous section. However, instead of feeding the examples directly into the `FewShotPromptTemplate` object, we will feed them into an `ExampleSelector` object.

In this tutorial, we will use the `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector` class. This class selects few-shot examples based on their similarity to the input. It uses an embedding model to compute the similarity between the input and the few-shot examples, as well as a vector store to perform the nearest neighbor search.

```
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_core.example_selectors import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.from_examples(
    # This is the list of examples available to select from.
    examples,
    # This is the embedding class used to produce embeddings which are used to measure semantic similarity.
    OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    # This is the VectorStore class that is used to store the embeddings and do a similarity search over.
    Chroma,
    # This is the number of examples to produce.
    k=1,
)

# Select the most similar example to the input.
question = "Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?"
selected_examples = example_selector.select_examples({"question": question})
print(f"Examples most similar to the input: {question}")
for example in selected_examples:
    print("\n")
    for k, v in example.items():
        print(f"{k}: {v}")

```


```
Examples most similar to the input: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?


answer: 
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
So the final answer is: Joseph Ball

question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?

```


### Feed example selector into `FewShotPromptTemplate`[‚Äã](#feed-example-selector-into-fewshotprompttemplate "Direct link to feed-example-selector-into-fewshotprompttemplate")

Finally, create a `FewShotPromptTemplate` object. This object takes in the example selector and the formatter for the few-shot examples.

```
prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    example_selector=example_selector,
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    suffix="Question: {input}",
    input_variables=["input"],
)

print(prompt.format(input="Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?"))

```


```
Question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?

Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
So the final answer is: Joseph Ball


Question: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
