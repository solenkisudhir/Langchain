Overview[‚Äã](#overview "Direct link to Overview")
------------------------------------------------

We‚Äôll go over an example of how to design and implement an LLM-powered chatbot. Here are a few of the high-level components we‚Äôll be working with:

*   `Chat Models`. The chatbot interface is based around messages rather than raw text, and therefore is best suited to Chat Models rather than text LLMs. See [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/chat/) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/llms/)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface.
*   `Prompt Templates`, which simplify the process of assembling prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context.
*   `Chat History`, which allows a chatbot to ‚Äúremember‚Äù past interactions and take them into account when responding to followup questions. [See here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/memory/chat_messages/) for more information.
*   `Retrievers` (optional), which are useful if you want to build a chatbot that can use domain-specific, up-to-date knowledge as context to augment its responses. [See here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems.

We‚Äôll cover how to fit the above components together to create a powerful conversational chatbot.

Quickstart[‚Äã](#quickstart "Direct link to Quickstart")
------------------------------------------------------

To start, let‚Äôs install some dependencies and set the required credentials:

```
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain langchain-openai langchain-chroma

# Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file:
import dotenv

dotenv.load_dotenv()

```


```
WARNING: You are using pip version 22.0.4; however, version 23.3.2 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the '/Users/jacoblee/.pyenv/versions/3.10.5/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.

```


Let‚Äôs initialize the chat model which will serve as the chatbot‚Äôs brain:

```
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

chat = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", temperature=0.2)

```


If we invoke our chat model, the output is an `AIMessage`:

```
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

chat.invoke(
    [
        HumanMessage(
            content="Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."
        )
    ]
)

```


```
AIMessage(content="J'adore programmer.")

```


The model on its own does not have any concept of state. For example, if you ask a followup question:

```
chat.invoke([HumanMessage(content="What did you just say?")])

```


```
AIMessage(content='I said, "What did you just say?"')

```


We can see that it doesn‚Äôt take the previous conversation turn into context, and cannot answer the question.

To get around this, we need to pass the entire conversation history into the model. Let‚Äôs see what happens when we do that:

```
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage

chat.invoke(
    [
        HumanMessage(
            content="Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."
        ),
        AIMessage(content="J'adore la programmation."),
        HumanMessage(content="What did you just say?"),
    ]
)

```


```
AIMessage(content='I said "J\'adore la programmation," which means "I love programming" in French.')

```


And now we can see that we get a good response!

This is the basic idea underpinning a chatbot‚Äôs ability to interact conversationally.

Prompt templates[‚Äã](#prompt-templates "Direct link to Prompt templates")
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let‚Äôs define a prompt template to make formatting a bit easier. We can create a chain by piping it into the model:

```
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a helpful assistant. Answer all questions to the best of your ability.",
        ),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="messages"),
    ]
)

chain = prompt | chat

```


The `MessagesPlaceholder` above inserts chat messages passed into the chain‚Äôs input as `chat_history` directly into the prompt. Then, we can invoke the chain like this:

```
chain.invoke(
    {
        "messages": [
            HumanMessage(
                content="Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."
            ),
            AIMessage(content="J'adore la programmation."),
            HumanMessage(content="What did you just say?"),
        ],
    }
)

```


```
AIMessage(content='I said "J\'adore la programmation," which means "I love programming" in French.')

```


Message history[‚Äã](#message-history "Direct link to Message history")
---------------------------------------------------------------------

As a shortcut for managing the chat history, we can use a [`MessageHistory`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/memory/chat_messages/) class, which is responsible for saving and loading chat messages. There are many built-in message history integrations that persist messages to a variety of databases, but for this quickstart we‚Äôll use a in-memory, demo message history called `ChatMessageHistory`.

Here‚Äôs an example of using it directly:

```
from langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistory

demo_ephemeral_chat_history = ChatMessageHistory()

demo_ephemeral_chat_history.add_user_message("hi!")

demo_ephemeral_chat_history.add_ai_message("whats up?")

demo_ephemeral_chat_history.messages

```


```
[HumanMessage(content='hi!'), AIMessage(content='whats up?')]

```


Once we do that, we can pass the stored messages directly into our chain as a parameter:

```
demo_ephemeral_chat_history.add_user_message(
    "Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."
)

response = chain.invoke({"messages": demo_ephemeral_chat_history.messages})

response

```


```
AIMessage(content='The translation of "I love programming" in French is "J\'adore la programmation."')

```


```
demo_ephemeral_chat_history.add_ai_message(response)

demo_ephemeral_chat_history.add_user_message("What did you just say?")

chain.invoke({"messages": demo_ephemeral_chat_history.messages})

```


```
AIMessage(content='I said "J\'adore la programmation," which is the French translation for "I love programming."')

```


And now we have a basic chatbot!

While this chain can serve as a useful chatbot on its own with just the model‚Äôs internal knowledge, it‚Äôs often useful to introduce some form of `retrieval-augmented generation`, or RAG for short, over domain-specific knowledge to make our chatbot more focused. We‚Äôll cover this next.

Retrievers[‚Äã](#retrievers "Direct link to Retrievers")
------------------------------------------------------

We can set up and use a [`Retriever`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/) to pull domain-specific knowledge for our chatbot. To show this, let‚Äôs expand the simple chatbot we created above to be able to answer questions about LangSmith.

We‚Äôll use [the LangSmith documentation](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/overview) as source material and store it in a vectorstore for later retrieval. Note that this example will gloss over some of the specifics around parsing and storing a data source - you can see more [in-depth documentation on creating retrieval systems here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/).

Let‚Äôs set up our retriever. First, we‚Äôll install some required deps:

```
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain-chroma beautifulsoup4

```


```
WARNING: You are using pip version 22.0.4; however, version 23.3.2 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the '/Users/jacoblee/.pyenv/versions/3.10.5/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.

```


Next, we‚Äôll use a document loader to pull data from a webpage:

```
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader

loader = WebBaseLoader("https://docs.smith.langchain.com/overview")
data = loader.load()

```


Next, we split it into smaller chunks that the LLM‚Äôs context window can handle and store it in a vector database:

```
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0)
all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data)

```


Then we embed and store those chunks in a vector database:

```
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())

```


And finally, let‚Äôs create a retriever from our initialized vectorstore:

```
# k is the number of chunks to retrieve
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(k=4)

docs = retriever.invoke("how can langsmith help with testing?")

docs

```


```

```


We can see that invoking the retriever above results in some parts of the LangSmith docs that contain information about testing that our chatbot can use as context when answering questions.

### Handling documents[‚Äã](#handling-documents "Direct link to Handling documents")

Let‚Äôs modify our previous prompt to accept documents as context. We‚Äôll use a [`create_stuff_documents_chain`](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.combine_documents.stuff.create_stuff_documents_chain.html#langchain.chains.combine_documents.stuff.create_stuff_documents_chain) helper function to ‚Äústuff‚Äù all of the input documents into the prompt, which also conveniently handles formatting. We use the [`ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/quick_start/#chatprompttemplate) method to format the message input we want to pass to the model, including a [`MessagesPlaceholder`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/quick_start/#messagesplaceholder) where chat history messages will be directly injected:

```
from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chain

chat = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106")

question_answering_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "Answer the user's questions based on the below context:\n\n{context}",
        ),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="messages"),
    ]
)

document_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(chat, question_answering_prompt)

```


We can invoke this `document_chain` with the raw documents we retrieved above:

```
from langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistory

demo_ephemeral_chat_history = ChatMessageHistory()

demo_ephemeral_chat_history.add_user_message("how can langsmith help with testing?")

document_chain.invoke(
    {
        "messages": demo_ephemeral_chat_history.messages,
        "context": docs,
    }
)

```


```
'LangSmith can assist with testing by providing the capability to quickly edit examples and add them to datasets. This allows for the expansion of evaluation sets or fine-tuning of a model for improved quality or reduced costs. Additionally, LangSmith simplifies the construction of small datasets by hand, providing a convenient way to rigorously test changes in the application.'

```


Awesome! We see an answer synthesized from information in the input documents.

### Creating a retrieval chain[‚Äã](#creating-a-retrieval-chain "Direct link to Creating a retrieval chain")

Next, let‚Äôs integrate our retriever into the chain. Our retriever should retrieve information relevant to the last message we pass in from the user, so we extract it and use that as input to fetch relevant docs, which we add to the current chain as `context`. We pass `context` plus the previous `messages` into our document chain to generate a final answer.

We also use the [`RunnablePassthrough.assign()`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/primitives/assign/) method to pass intermediate steps through at each invocation. Here‚Äôs what it looks like:

```
from typing import Dict

from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough


def parse_retriever_input(params: Dict):
    return params["messages"][-1].content


retrieval_chain = RunnablePassthrough.assign(
    context=parse_retriever_input | retriever,
).assign(
    answer=document_chain,
)

```


```
response = retrieval_chain.invoke(
    {
        "messages": demo_ephemeral_chat_history.messages,
    }
)

response

```

Nice! Our chatbot can now answer domain-specific questions in a conversational way.

As an aside, if you don‚Äôt want to return all the intermediate steps, you can define your retrieval chain like this using a pipe directly into the document chain instead of the final `.assign()` call:

```
retrieval_chain_with_only_answer = (
    RunnablePassthrough.assign(
        context=parse_retriever_input | retriever,
    )
    | document_chain
)

)

```


```
"LangSmith offers the capability to quickly edit examples and add them to datasets, thereby enhancing the scope of evaluation sets. This feature is particularly valuable for testing as it allows for a more thorough assessment of model performance and application behavior.\n\nFurthermore, LangSmith enables the fine-tuning of models to enhance quality and reduce costs, which can significantly impact testing outcomes. By adjusting and refining models, developers can ensure that they are thoroughly tested and optimized for various scenarios and use cases.\n\nAdditionally, LangSmith provides monitoring functionality, allowing users to log traces, visualize latency and token usage statistics, and troubleshoot specific issues as they encounter them during testing.

Query transformation[‚Äã](#query-transformation "Direct link to Query transformation")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There‚Äôs one more optimization we‚Äôll cover here - in the above example, when we asked a followup question, `tell me more about that!`, you might notice that the retrieved docs don‚Äôt directly include information about testing. This is because we‚Äôre passing `tell me more about that!` verbatim as a query to the retriever. The output in the retrieval chain is still okay because the document chain retrieval chain can generate an answer based on the chat history, but we could be retrieving more rich and informative documents:

```
retriever.invoke("how can langsmith help with testing?")

```

To get around this common problem, let‚Äôs add a `query transformation` step that removes references from the input. We‚Äôll wrap our old retriever as follows:

```
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableBranch

# We need a prompt that we can pass into an LLM to generate a transformed search query

chat = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", temperature=0.2)

query_transform_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="messages"),
        (
            "user",
            "Given the above conversation, generate a search query to look up in order to get information relevant to the conversation. Only respond with the query, nothing else.",
        ),
    ]
)

query_transforming_retriever_chain = RunnableBranch(
    (
        lambda x: len(x.get("messages", [])) == 1,
        # If only one message, then we just pass that message's content to retriever
        (lambda x: x["messages"][-1].content) | retriever,
    ),
    # If messages, then we pass inputs to LLM chain to transform the query, then pass to retriever
    query_transform_prompt | chat | StrOutputParser() | retriever,
).with_config(run_name="chat_retriever_chain")

```


Now let‚Äôs recreate our earlier chain with this new `query_transforming_retriever_chain`. Note that this new chain accepts a dict as input and parses a string to pass to the retriever, so we don‚Äôt have to do additional parsing at the top level:

```
document_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(chat, question_answering_prompt)

conversational_retrieval_chain = RunnablePassthrough.assign(
    context=query_transforming_retriever_chain,
).assign(
    answer=document_chain,
)

demo_ephemeral_chat_history = ChatMessageHistory()

```


And finally, let‚Äôs invoke it!

```
demo_ephemeral_chat_history.add_user_message("how can langsmith help with testing?")

response = conversational_retrieval_chain.invoke(
    {"messages": demo_ephemeral_chat_history.messages},
)

demo_ephemeral_chat_history.add_ai_message(response["answer"])

response

```
