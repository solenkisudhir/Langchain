# Agents | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain
The core idea of agents is to use a language model to choose a sequence of actions to take. In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code). In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a quick start to working with agents, please check out [this getting started guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/quick_start/). This covers basics like initializing an agent, creating tools, and adding memory.

[Concepts](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/concepts/)[‚Äã](#concepts "Direct link to concepts")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several key concepts to understand when building agents: Agents, AgentExecutor, Tools, Toolkits. For an in depth explanation, please check out [this conceptual guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/concepts/)

[Agent Types](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/)[‚Äã](#agent-types "Direct link to agent-types")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many different types of agents to use. For a overview of the different types and when to use them, please check out [this section](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/).

Agents are only as good as the tools they have. For a comprehensive guide on tools, please see [this section](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/tools/).
