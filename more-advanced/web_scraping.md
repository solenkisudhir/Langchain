Use case[‚Äã](#use-case "Direct link to Use case")
------------------------------------------------

[Web research](https://blog.langchain.dev/automating-web-research/) is one of the killer LLM applications:

*   Users have [highlighted it](https://twitter.com/GregKamradt/status/1679913813297225729?s=20) as one of his top desired AI tools.
*   OSS repos like [gpt-researcher](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher) are growing in popularity.

Overview[‚Äã](#overview "Direct link to Overview")
------------------------------------------------

Gathering content from the web has a few components:

*   `Search`: Query to url (e.g., using `GoogleSearchAPIWrapper`).
*   `Loading`: Url to HTML (e.g., using `AsyncHtmlLoader`, `AsyncChromiumLoader`, etc).
*   `Transforming`: HTML to formatted text (e.g., using `HTML2Text` or `Beautiful Soup`).

Quickstart[‚Äã](#quickstart "Direct link to Quickstart")
------------------------------------------------------

```
pip install -q langchain-openai langchain playwright beautifulsoup4
playwright install

# Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file:
# import dotenv
# dotenv.load_dotenv()

```


Scraping HTML content using a headless instance of Chromium.

*   The async nature of the scraping process is handled using Python‚Äôs asyncio library.
*   The actual interaction with the web pages is handled by Playwright.

```
from langchain_community.document_loaders import AsyncChromiumLoader
from langchain_community.document_transformers import BeautifulSoupTransformer

# Load HTML
loader = AsyncChromiumLoader(["https://www.wsj.com"])
html = loader.load()

```


Scrape text content tags such as `<p>, <li>, <div>, and <a>` tags from the HTML content:

*   `<p>`: The paragraph tag. It defines a paragraph in HTML and is used to group together related sentences and/or phrases.
    
*   `<li>`: The list item tag. It is used within ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists to define individual items within the list.
    
*   `<div>`: The division tag. It is a block-level element used to group other inline or block-level elements.
    
*   `<a>`: The anchor tag. It is used to define hyperlinks.
    
*   `<span>`: an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
    

For many news websites (e.g., WSJ, CNN), headlines and summaries are all in `<span>` tags.

```
# Transform
bs_transformer = BeautifulSoupTransformer()
docs_transformed = bs_transformer.transform_documents(html, tags_to_extract=["span"])

```


```
# Result
docs_transformed[0].page_content[0:500]

```

These `Documents` now are staged for downstream usage in various LLM apps, as discussed below.

Loader[‚Äã](#loader "Direct link to Loader")
------------------------------------------

### AsyncHtmlLoader[‚Äã](#asynchtmlloader "Direct link to AsyncHtmlLoader")

The [AsyncHtmlLoader](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/async_html/) uses the `aiohttp` library to make asynchronous HTTP requests, suitable for simpler and lightweight scraping.

### AsyncChromiumLoader[‚Äã](#asyncchromiumloader "Direct link to AsyncChromiumLoader")

The [AsyncChromiumLoader](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/async_chromium/) uses Playwright to launch a Chromium instance, which can handle JavaScript rendering and more complex web interactions.

Chromium is one of the browsers supported by Playwright, a library used to control browser automation.

Headless mode means that the browser is running without a graphical user interface, which is commonly used for web scraping.

```
from langchain_community.document_loaders import AsyncHtmlLoader

urls = ["https://www.espn.com", "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/"]
loader = AsyncHtmlLoader(urls)
docs = loader.load()

```


Transformer[‚Äã](#transformer "Direct link to Transformer")
---------------------------------------------------------

### HTML2Text[‚Äã](#html2text "Direct link to HTML2Text")

[HTML2Text](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_transformers/html2text/) provides a straightforward conversion of HTML content into plain text (with markdown-like formatting) without any specific tag manipulation.

It‚Äôs best suited for scenarios where the goal is to extract human-readable text without needing to manipulate specific HTML elements.

### Beautiful Soup[‚Äã](#beautiful-soup "Direct link to Beautiful Soup")

Beautiful Soup offers more fine-grained control over HTML content, enabling specific tag extraction, removal, and content cleaning.

It‚Äôs suited for cases where you want to extract specific information and clean up the HTML content according to your needs.

```
from langchain_community.document_loaders import AsyncHtmlLoader

urls = ["https://www.espn.com", "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/"]
loader = AsyncHtmlLoader(urls)
docs = loader.load()

```

```


### LLM with function calling[‚Äã](#llm-with-function-calling "Direct link to LLM with function calling")

Web scraping is challenging for many reasons.

One of them is the changing nature of modern websites‚Äô layouts and content, which requires modifying scraping scripts to accommodate the changes.

Using Function (e.g., OpenAI) with an extraction chain, we avoid having to change your code constantly when websites change.

We‚Äôre using `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` to guarantee access to OpenAI Functions feature (although this might be available to everyone by time of writing).

We‚Äôre also keeping `temperature` at `0` to keep randomness of the LLM down.

```
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0613")

```


### Define a schema[‚Äã](#define-a-schema "Direct link to Define a schema")

Next, you define a schema to specify what kind of data you want to extract.

Here, the key names matter as they tell the LLM what kind of information they want.

So, be as detailed as possible.

In this example, we want to scrape only news article‚Äôs name and summary from The Wall Street Journal website.

```
from langchain.chains import create_extraction_chain

schema = {
    "properties": {
        "news_article_title": {"type": "string"},
        "news_article_summary": {"type": "string"},
    },
    "required": ["news_article_title", "news_article_summary"],
}


def extract(content: str, schema: dict):
    return create_extraction_chain(schema=schema, llm=llm).run(content)

```


### Run the web scraper w/ BeautifulSoup[‚Äã](#run-the-web-scraper-w-beautifulsoup "Direct link to Run the web scraper w/ BeautifulSoup")

As shown above, we‚Äôll be using `BeautifulSoupTransformer`.

```
import pprint

from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter


def scrape_with_playwright(urls, schema):
    loader = AsyncChromiumLoader(urls)
    docs = loader.load()
    bs_transformer = BeautifulSoupTransformer()
    docs_transformed = bs_transformer.transform_documents(
        docs, tags_to_extract=["span"]
    )
    print("Extracting content with LLM")

    # Grab the first 1000 tokens of the site
    splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(
        chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0
    )
    splits = splitter.split_documents(docs_transformed)

    # Process the first split
    extracted_content = extract(schema=schema, content=splits[0].page_content)
    pprint.pprint(extracted_content)
    return extracted_content


urls = ["https://www.wsj.com"]
extracted_content = scrape_with_playwright(urls, schema=schema)

```


```

Looking at the [LangSmith trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/c3070198-5b13-419b-87bf-3821cdf34fa6/r), we can see what is going on under the hood:

*   It‚Äôs following what is explained in the [extraction](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/web_scraping/docs/use_cases/extraction/).
*   We call the `information_extraction` function on the input text.
*   It will attempt to populate the provided schema from the url content.

Research automation[‚Äã](#research-automation "Direct link to Research automation")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Related to scraping, we may want to answer specific questions using searched content.

We can automate the process of [web research](https://blog.langchain.dev/automating-web-research/) using a retriever, such as the `WebResearchRetriever`.

![Image description](https://python.langchain.com/assets/images/web_research-f87a6bc469722c6804652383a65306de.png)

Copy requirements [from here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/web-explorer/blob/main/requirements.txt):

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Set `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

```
from langchain.retrievers.web_research import WebResearchRetriever
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_community.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings

```


```
# Vectorstore
vectorstore = Chroma(
    embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings(), persist_directory="./chroma_db_oai"
)

# LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

# Search
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()

```


Initialize retriever with the above tools to:

*   Use an LLM to generate multiple relevant search queries (one LLM call)
*   Execute a search for each query
*   Choose the top K links per query (multiple search calls in parallel)
*   Load the information from all chosen links (scrape pages in parallel)
*   Index those documents into a vectorstore
*   Find the most relevant documents for each original generated search query

```
# Initialize
web_research_retriever = WebResearchRetriever.from_llm(

### Going deeper[‚Äã](#going-deeper "Direct link to Going deeper")

*   Here‚Äôs a [app](https://github.com/langchain-ai/web-explorer/tree/main) that wraps this retriever with a lighweight UI.

Question answering over a website[‚Äã](#question-answering-over-a-website "Direct link to Question answering over a website")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To answer questions over a specific website, you can use Apify‚Äôs [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor, which can deeply crawl websites such as documentation, knowledge bases, help centers, or blogs, and extract text content from the web pages.

In the example below, we will deeply crawl the Python documentation of LangChain‚Äôs Chat LLM models and answer a question over it.

First, install the requirements `pip install apify-client langchain-openai langchain`

Next, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `APIFY_API_TOKEN` in your environment variables.

The full code follows:

```
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
from langchain_community.docstore.document import Document
from langchain_community.utilities import ApifyWrapper

apify = ApifyWrapper()
# Call the Actor to obtain text from the crawled webpages
loader = apify.call_actor(
    actor_id="apify/website-content-crawler",
    run_input={"startUrls": [{"url": "/docs/integrations/chat/"}]},
    dataset_mapping_function=lambda item: Document(
        page_content=item["text"] or "", metadata={"source": item["url"]}
    ),
)

# Create a vector store based on the crawled data
index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])

# Query the vector store
query = "Are any OpenAI chat models integrated in LangChain?"
result = index.query(query)
print(result)

```


```
 Yes, LangChain offers integration with OpenAI chat models. You can use the ChatOpenAI class to interact with OpenAI models.

```
