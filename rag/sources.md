# Returning sources | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain
Often in Q&A applications it‚Äôs important to show users the sources that were used to generate the answer. The simplest way to do this is for the chain to return the Documents that were retrieved in each generation.

We‚Äôll work off of the Q&A app we built over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post by Lilian Weng in the [Quickstart](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/quickstart/).

Setup[‚Äã](#setup "Direct link to Setup")
---------------------------------------

### Dependencies[‚Äã](#dependencies "Direct link to Dependencies")

We‚Äôll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/chat/) or [LLM](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/llms/), [Embeddings](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/).

We‚Äôll use the following packages:

```
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community langchainhub langchain-openai langchain-chroma bs4

```


We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so:

```
import getpass
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()

# import dotenv

# dotenv.load_dotenv()

```


### LangSmith[‚Äã](#langsmith "Direct link to LangSmith")

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/).

Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:

```
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()

```


Chain without sources[‚Äã](#chain-without-sources "Direct link to Chain without sources")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the Q&A app we built over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post by Lilian Weng in the [Quickstart](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/quickstart/):

```
import bs4
from langchain import hub
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

```


```
# Load, chunk and index the contents of the blog.
bs_strainer = bs4.SoupStrainer(class_=("post-content", "post-title", "post-header"))
loader = WebBaseLoader(
    web_paths=("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",),
    bs_kwargs={"parse_only": bs_strainer},
)
docs = loader.load()

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())

# Retrieve and generate using the relevant snippets of the blog.
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
prompt = hub.pull("rlm/rag-prompt")
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)


def format_docs(docs):
    return "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)


rag_chain = (
    {"context": retriever | format_docs, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)

```


```
rag_chain.invoke("What is Task Decomposition?")

```


```
'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.'

```


Adding sources[‚Äã](#adding-sources "Direct link to Adding sources")
------------------------------------------------------------------

With LCEL it‚Äôs easy to return the retrieved documents:

```
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableParallel

rag_chain_from_docs = (
    RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=(lambda x: format_docs(x["context"])))
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)

rag_chain_with_source = RunnableParallel(
    {"context": retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
).assign(answer=rag_chain_from_docs)

rag_chain_with_source.invoke("What is Task Decomposition")

```
