# Handle Long Text | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain
When working with files, like PDFs, you‚Äôre likely to encounter text that exceeds your language model‚Äôs context window. To process this text, consider these strategies:

Keep in mind that these strategies have different trade off and the best strategy likely depends on the application that you‚Äôre designing!

We need some example data! Let‚Äôs download an article about [cars from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car) and load it as a LangChain `Document`.

Here, we‚Äôll define schema to extract key developments from the text.

```

    """Information about a development in the history of cars."""

    # ^ Doc-string for the entity Person.
    # This doc-string is sent to the LLM as the description of the schema Person,
    # and it can help to improve extraction results.
    # Note that all fields are required rather than optional!
    year: int = Field(
        ..., description="The year when there was an important historic development."
    )
    description: str = Field(
        ..., description="What happened in this year? What was the development?"
    )
    evidence: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Repeat in verbatim the sentence(s) from which the year and description information were extracted",
    )


class ExtractionData(BaseModel):
    """Extracted information about key developments in the history of cars."""

    key_developments: List[KeyDevelopment]


# Define a custom prompt to provide instructions and any additional context.
# 1) You can add examples into the prompt template to improve extraction quality
# 2) Introduce additional parameters to take context into account (e.g., include metadata
#    about the document from which the text was extracted.)
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are an expert at identifying key historic development in text. "
            "Only extract important historic developments. Extract nothing if no important information can be found in the text.",
        ),
        # MessagesPlaceholder('examples'), # Keep on reading through this use case to see how to use examples to improve performance
        ("human", "{text}"),

# We will be using tool calling mode, which
# requires a tool calling capable model.
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    # Consider benchmarking with a good model to get
    # a sense of the best possible quality.
    model="gpt-4-0125-preview",
    # Remember to set the temperature to 0 for extractions!
    temperature=0,

Split the documents into chunks such that each chunk fits into the context window of the LLMs.

After extracting data from across the chunks, we‚Äôll want to merge the extractions together.

Another simple idea is to chunk up the text, but instead of extracting information from every chunk, just focus on the the most relevant chunks.

Here‚Äôs a simple example that relies on the `FAISS` vectorstore.

In this case the RAG extractor is only looking at the top document.

```
year=1924 description="Germany's first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch, was produced, making Opel the top car builder in Germany with 37.5% of the market." evidence="Germany's first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), came off the line at R√ºsselsheim in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5 per cent of the market."
year=1925 description='Morris had 41% of total British car production, dominating the market.' evidence='in 1925, Morris had 41 per cent of total British car production.'
year=1925 description='Citro√´n, Renault, and Peugeot produced 550,000 cars in France, dominating the market.' evidence="Citro√´n did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault's 10CV and Peugeot's 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925."
year=2017 description='Production of petrol-fuelled cars peaked.' evidence='Production of petrol-fuelled cars peaked in 2017.'

Different methods have their own pros and cons related to cost, speed, and accuracy.
