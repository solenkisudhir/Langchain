# Caching | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain
LangChain provides an optional caching layer for LLMs. This is useful for two reasons:

It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider, if you‚Äôre often requesting the same completion multiple times. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider.

```
from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

# To make the caching really obvious, lets use a slower model.
llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", n=2, best_of=2)

```


```
%%time
from langchain.cache import InMemoryCache

set_llm_cache(InMemoryCache())

# The first time, it is not yet in cache, so it should take longer
llm.predict("Tell me a joke")

```


```
