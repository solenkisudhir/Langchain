# PDF | 🦜️🔗 LangChain
[Portable Document Format (PDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF), standardized as ISO 32000, is a file format developed by Adobe in 1992 to present documents, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.

This covers how to load `PDF` documents into the Document format that we use downstream.

Load PDF using `pypdf` into array of documents, where each document contains the page content and metadata with `page` number.

An advantage of this approach is that documents can be retrieved with page numbers.

We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.

This is the fastest of the PDF parsing options, and contains detailed metadata about the PDF and its pages, as well as returns one document per page.

Additionally, you can pass along any of the options from the [PyMuPDF documentation](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/app1.html#plain-text/) as keyword arguments in the `load` call, and it will be pass along to the `get_text()` call.

The `unstructured[all-docs]` package currently supports loading of text files, powerpoints, html, pdfs, images, and more.

Under the hood, Unstructured creates different "elements" for different chunks of text. By default we combine those together, but you can easily keep that separation by specifying `mode="elements"`.

When p = d + 1 − s the proof relies on the Cayley trick, a trick which associates to X a quasi-smooth hypersurface Y in a projective vector bundle, and the Cayley Proposition (4.3) which gives an isomorphism of some primitive cohomologies (4.2) of X and Y . The Cayley trick, following the philosophy of Mavlyutov in [7], reduces results known for quasi-smooth hypersurfaces to quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties.

The irrelevant ideal of P d Σ is the monomial ideal B Σ ∶ =< x ˆ σ ∣ σ ∈ Σ > and the zero locus Z ( Σ ) ∶ = V ( B Σ ) in the aﬃne space A d ∶ = Spec ( S ) is the irrelevant locus.\n\nProposition 2.3 (Theorem 5.1.11 [5]) . The toric variety P d Σ is a categorical quotient A d ∖ Z ( Σ ) by the group Hom ( Cl ( Σ ) , C ∗ ) and the group action is induced by the Cl ( Σ ) - grading of S .\n\nNow we give a brief introduction to complex orbifolds and we mention the needed theorems for the next section. Namely: de Rham theorem and Dolbeault theorem for complex orbifolds.\n\nDeﬁnition 2.4. A complex orbifold of complex dimension d is a singular complex space whose singularities are locally isomorphic to quotient singularities C d / G , for ﬁnite sub- groups G ⊂ Gl ( d, C ) .\n\nDeﬁnition 2.5.

Quasi-smooth hypersurfaces or more generally quasi-smooth intersection sub- varieties are quasi-smooth subvarieties (see [2] or [7] for more details).\n\nRemark 3.3 . Quasi-smooth subvarieties are suborbifolds of P d Σ in the sense of Satake in [8]. Intuitively speaking they are subvarieties whose only singularities come from the ambient\n\nProof. From the exponential short exact sequence\n\nwe have a long exact sequence in cohomology\n\nH 1 (O ∗ X ) → H 2 ( X, Z ) → H 2 (O X ) ≃ H 0 , 2 ( X )\n\nwhere the last isomorphisms is due to Steenbrink in [9].

If the dimension of X is 1 , 2 or 3 . The Hodge conjecture holds on X\n\nProof. If the dim C X = 1 the result is clear by the Hard Lefschetz theorem for projective orbifolds. The dimension 2 and 3 cases are covered by Theorem 3.5 and the Hard Lefschetz.\n\nCayley trick and Cayley proposition\n\nThe Cayley trick is a way to associate to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety a quasi- smooth hypersurface. Let L 1 , . . . , L s be line bundles on P d Σ and let π ∶ P ( E ) → P d Σ be the projective space bundle associated to the vector bundle E = L 1 ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ L s . It is known that P ( E ) is a ( d + s − 1 ) -dimensional simplicial toric variety whose fan depends on the degrees of the line bundles and the fan Σ. Furthermore, if the Cox ring, without considering the grading, of P d Σ is C [ x 1 , . . . , x m ] then the Cox ring of P ( E ) is\n\nMoreover for X a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety cut oﬀ by f 1 , . . . , f s with deg ( f i ) = [ L i ] we relate the hypersurface Y cut oﬀ by F = y 1 f 1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + y s f s which turns out to be quasi-smooth. For more details see Section 2 in [7].\n\nWe will denote P ( E ) as P d + s − 1 Σ ,X to keep track of its relation with X and P d Σ .\n\nThe following is a key remark.\n\nRemark 4.1 . There is a morphism ι ∶ X → Y ⊂ P d + s − 1 Σ ,X . Moreover every point z ∶ = ( x, y ) ∈ Y with y ≠ 0 has a preimage. Hence for any subvariety W = V ( I W ) ⊂ X ⊂ P d Σ there exists W ′ ⊂ Y ⊂ P d + s − 1 Σ ,X such that π ( W ′ ) = W , i.e., W ′ = { z = ( x, y ) ∣ x ∈ W } .\n\nFor X ⊂ P d Σ a quasi-smooth intersection variety the morphism in cohomology induced by the inclusion i ∗ ∶ H d − s ( P d Σ , C ) → H d − s ( X, C ) is injective by Proposition 1.4 in [7].\n\nDeﬁnition 4.2. The primitive cohomology of H d − s prim ( X ) is the quotient H d − s ( X, C )/ i ∗ ( H d − s ( P d Σ , C )) and H d − s prim ( X, Q ) with rational coeﬃcients.\n\nH d − s ( P d Σ , C ) and H d − s ( X, C ) have pure Hodge structures, and the morphism i ∗ is com- patible with them, so that H d − s prim ( X ) gets a pure Hodge structure.\n\nThe next Proposition is the Cayley proposition.\n\nProposition 4.3. [Proposition 2.3 in [3] ] Let X = X 1 ∩⋅ ⋅ ⋅∩ X s be a quasi-smooth intersec- tion subvariety in P d Σ cut oﬀ by homogeneous polynomials f 1 . . . f s . Then for p ≠ d + s − 1 2 , d + s − 3 2\n\nRemark 4.5 . The above isomorphisms are also true with rational coeﬃcients since H ● ( X, C ) = H ● ( X, Q ) ⊗ Q C . See the beginning of Section 7.1 in [10] for more details.\n\nTheorem 5.1. Let Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯ + y k f k = 0 } ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to the quasi-smooth intersection surface X = X f 1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ X f k ⊂ P k + 2 Σ . Then on Y the Hodge conjecture holds.\n\nthe Hodge conjecture holds.\n\nProof. If H k,k prim ( X, Q ) = 0 we are done. So let us assume H k,k prim ( X, Q ) ≠ 0. By the Cayley proposition H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) ≃ H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) and by the ( 1 , 1 ) -Lefschetz theorem for projective\n\ntoric orbifolds there is a non-zero algebraic basis λ C 1 , . . . , λ C n with rational coeﬃcients of H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) , that is, there are n ∶ = h 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) algebraic curves C 1 , . . . , C n in X such that under the Poincar´e duality the class in homology [ C i ] goes to λ C i , [ C i ] ↦ λ C i . Recall that the Cox ring of P k + 2 is contained in the Cox ring of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X without considering the grading. Considering the grading we have that if α ∈ Cl ( P k + 2 Σ ) then ( α, 0 ) ∈ Cl ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ) . So the polynomials deﬁning C i ⊂ P k + 2 Σ can be interpreted in P 2 k + 1 X, Σ but with diﬀerent degree. Moreover, by Remark 4.1 each C i is contained in Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯ + y k f k = 0 } and\n\nfurthermore it has codimension k .\n\nClaim: { C i } ni = 1 is a basis of prim ( ) . It is enough to prove that λ C i is diﬀerent from zero in H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) or equivalently that the cohomology classes { λ C i } ni = 1 do not come from the ambient space. By contradiction, let us assume that there exists a j and C ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that λ C ∈ H k,k ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X , Q ) with i ∗ ( λ C ) = λ C j or in terms of homology there exists a ( k + 2 ) -dimensional algebraic subvariety V ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that V ∩ Y = C j so they are equal as a homology class of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ,i.e., [ V ∩ Y ] = [ C j ] . It is easy to check that π ( V ) ∩ X = C j as a subvariety of P k + 2 Σ where π ∶ ( x, y ) ↦ x . Hence [ π ( V ) ∩ X ] = [ C j ] which is equivalent to say that λ C j comes from P k + 2 Σ which contradicts the choice of [ C j ] .\n\nRemark 5.2 . Into the proof of the previous theorem, the key fact was that on X the Hodge conjecture holds and we translate it to Y by contradiction. So, using an analogous argument we have:\n\nargument we have:\n\nProposition 5.3. Let Y = { F = y 1 f s +⋯+ y s f s = 0 } ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety X = X f 1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ X f s ⊂ P d Σ such that d + s = 2 ( k + 1 ) . If the Hodge conjecture holds on X then it holds as well on Y .\n\nCorollary 5.4. If the dimension of Y is 2 s − 1 , 2 s or 2 s + 1 then the Hodge conjecture holds on Y .\n\nProof.

PDFMiner is a tool that can help with extracting information and analyzing data from PDF documents.

This can be helpful for chunking texts semantically into sections as the output html content can be parsed via `BeautifulSoup` to get more structured and rich information about font size, page numbers, PDF headers/footers, etc.

```
from langchain_community.docstore.document import Document
cur_idx = -1
semantic_snippets = []
# Assumption: headings have higher font size than their respective content
for s in snippets:
    # if current snippet's font size > previous section's heading => it is a new heading
    if not semantic_snippets or s[1] > semantic_snippets[cur_idx].metadata['heading_font']:
        metadata={'heading':s[0], 'content_font': 0, 'heading_font': s[1]}
        metadata.update(data.metadata)
        semantic_snippets.append(Document(page_content='',metadata=metadata))
        cur_idx += 1
        continue

    # if current snippet's font size <= previous section's content => content belongs to the same section (one can also create
    # a tree like structure for sub sections if needed but that may require some more thinking and may be data specific)
    if not semantic_snippets[cur_idx].metadata['content_font'] or s[1] <= semantic_snippets[cur_idx].metadata['content_font']:
        semantic_snippets[cur_idx].page_content += s[0]
        semantic_snippets[cur_idx].metadata['content_font'] = max(s[1], semantic_snippets[cur_idx].metadata['content_font'])
        continue

    # if current snippet's font size > previous section's content but less than previous section's heading than also make a new
    # section (e.g. title of a PDF will have the highest font size but we don't want it to subsume all sections)

    Document(page_content='Recently, various DL models and datasets have been developed for layout analysis\ntasks. The dhSegment [22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [20] for segmen-\ntation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\nR-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38]\nand detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also\nbeen used in table detection [27]. However, these models are usually implemented\nindividually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\nrelevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21], it is designed for\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document\nAnalysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [15] and the DeepDIVA project [2]\naim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they\nare not actively maintained.

The AmazonTextractPDFLoader calls the [Amazon Textract Service](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) to convert PDFs into a Document structure. The loader does pure OCR at the moment, with more features like layout support planned, depending on demand. Single and multi-page documents are supported with up to 3000 pages and 512 MB of size.

For the call to be successful an AWS account is required, similar to the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) requirements.

Besides the AWS configuration, it is very similar to the other PDF loaders, while also supporting JPEG, PNG and TIFF and non-native PDF formats.

[Azure AI Document Intelligence](https://aka.ms/doc-intelligence) (formerly known as `Azure Form Recognizer`) is machine-learning based service that extracts texts (including handwriting), tables, document structures (e.g., titles, section headings, etc.) and key-value-pairs from digital or scanned PDFs, images, Office and HTML files. Document Intelligence supports `PDF`, `JPEG/JPG`, `PNG`, `BMP`, `TIFF`, `HEIF`, `DOCX`, `XLSX`, `PPTX` and `HTML`.

This [current implementation](https://aka.ms/di-langchain) of a loader using `Document Intelligence` can incorporate content page-wise and turn it into LangChain documents. The default output format is markdown, which can be easily chained with `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` for semantic document chunking. You can also use `mode="single"` or `mode="page"` to return pure texts in a single page or document split by page.

An Azure AI Document Intelligence resource in one of the 3 preview regions: **East US**, **West US2**, **West Europe** - follow [this document](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0) to create one if you don't have. You will be passing `<endpoint>` and `<key>` as parameters to the loader.

The UpstageLayoutAnalysisLoader invokes the [Upstage Layout Analysis API](https://developers.upstage.ai/docs/apis/layout-analyzer) to detect document elements, including tables and figures, from various document formats. This loader employs pure OCR to extract textual information and detect elements within documents such as `JPEG`, `PNG`, `BMP`, `PDF`, `TIFF`, and `HEIC` files. In the case of digital born PDF documents, users have the option to forego OCR and utilize text information within the file by setting use\_ocr=False, which is the default value. Both single and multi-page documents are supported, with a limit of 100 pages and a file size of 50 MB when use\_ocr=True, while there are no restrictions when use\_ocr=False (applicable to PDF files only).

To access the Upstage Layout Analysis API, you require an API access token. Kindly refer to the [quick start guide](https://developers.upstage.ai/docs/getting-started/quick-start) provided to obtain the access token and begin utilizing the Upstage Layout Analysis API.
