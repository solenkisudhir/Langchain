# Document loaders | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain
Use document loaders to load data from a source as `Document`'s. A `Document` is a piece of text and associated metadata. For example, there are document loaders for loading a simple `.txt` file, for loading the text contents of any web page, or even for loading a transcript of a YouTube video.

Document loaders provide a "load" method for loading data as documents from a configured source. They optionally implement a "lazy load" as well for lazily loading data into memory.
