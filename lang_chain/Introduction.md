# Introduction | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain
**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

*   **Development**: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source [building blocks](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/) and [components](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/). Hit the ground running using [third-party integrations](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/platforms/) and [Templates](https://python.langchain.com/docs/templates/).
*   **Productionization**: Use [LangSmith](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langsmith/) to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
*   **Deployment**: Turn any chain into an API with [LangServe](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve/).

Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:

*   **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
*   **`langchain-community`**: Third party integrations.
    *   Partner packages (e.g. **`langchain-openai`**, **`langchain-anthropic`**, etc.): Some integrations have been further split into their own lightweight packages that only depend on **`langchain-core`**.
*   **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
*   **[langgraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph/)**: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.
*   **[langserve](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve/)**: Deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs.

The broader ecosystem includes:

*   **[LangSmith](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langsmith/)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.

Get started[‚Äã](#get-started "Direct link to Get started")
---------------------------------------------------------

We recommend following our [Quickstart](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart/) guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application.

[See here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/installation/) for instructions on how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building.

note

These docs focus on the Python LangChain library. [Head here](https://js.langchain.com/) for docs on the JavaScript LangChain library.

Use cases[‚Äã](#use-cases "Direct link to Use cases")
---------------------------------------------------

If you're looking to build something specific or are more of a hands-on learner, check out our [use-cases](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/). They're walkthroughs and techniques for common end-to-end tasks, such as:

*   [Question answering with RAG](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/)
*   [Extracting structured output](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/extraction/)
*   [Chatbots](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/chatbots/)
*   and more!

Expression Language[‚Äã](#expression-language "Direct link to Expression Language")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is the foundation of many of LangChain's components, and is a declarative way to compose chains. LCEL was designed from day 1 to support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest ‚Äúprompt + LLM‚Äù chain to the most complex chains.

*   **[Get started](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/)**: LCEL and its benefits
*   **[Runnable interface](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/interface/)**: The standard interface for LCEL objects
*   **[Primitives](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/primitives/)**: More on the primitives LCEL includes
*   and more!
