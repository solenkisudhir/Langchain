# Route logic based on input | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain
Dynamically route logic based on input
--------------------------------------

This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language.

Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs.

There are two ways to perform routing:

1.  Conditionally return runnables from a [`RunnableLambda`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/primitives/functions/) (recommended)
2.  Using a `RunnableBranch`.

We‚Äôll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain.

Example Setup[‚Äã](#example-setup "Direct link to Example Setup")
---------------------------------------------------------------

First, let‚Äôs create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`:

```
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

chain = (
    PromptTemplate.from_template(
        """Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.

Do not respond with more than one word.

<question>
{question}
</question>

Classification:"""
    )
    | ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
    | StrOutputParser()
)

chain.invoke({"question": "how do I call Anthropic?"})

```


Now, let‚Äôs create three sub chains:

```
langchain_chain = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    """You are an expert in langchain. \
Always answer questions starting with "As Harrison Chase told me". \
Respond to the following question:

Question: {question}
Answer:"""
) | ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
anthropic_chain = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    """You are an expert in anthropic. \
Always answer questions starting with "As Dario Amodei told me". \
Respond to the following question:

Question: {question}
Answer:"""
) | ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
general_chain = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    """Respond to the following question:

Question: {question}
Answer:"""
) | ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")

```


Using a custom function (Recommended)[‚Äã](#using-a-custom-function-recommended "Direct link to Using a custom function (Recommended)")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also use a custom function to route between different outputs. Here‚Äôs an example:

```
def route(info):
    if "anthropic" in info["topic"].lower():
        return anthropic_chain
    elif "langchain" in info["topic"].lower():
        return langchain_chain
    else:
        return general_chain

```


```
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda

full_chain = {"topic": chain, "question": lambda x: x["question"]} | RunnableLambda(
    route
)

```


```
full_chain.invoke({"question": "how do I use Anthropic?"})

```


```

Using a RunnableBranch[‚Äã](#using-a-runnablebranch "Direct link to Using a RunnableBranch")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `RunnableBranch` is a special type of runnable that allows you to define a set of conditions and runnables to execute based on the input. It does **not** offer anything that you can‚Äôt achieve in a custom function as described above, so we recommend using a custom function instead.

A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it‚Äôs invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input.

If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable.

Here‚Äôs an example of what it looks like in action:

```
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableBranch

branch = RunnableBranch(
    (lambda x: "anthropic" in x["topic"].lower(), anthropic_chain),
    (lambda x: "langchain" in x["topic"].lower(), langchain_chain),
    general_chain,
)
full_chain = {"topic": chain, "question": lambda x: x["question"]} | branch
full_chain.invoke({"question": "how do I use Anthropic?"})

Routing by semantic similarity
------------------------------

One especially useful technique is to use embeddings to route a query to the most relevant prompt. Here‚Äôs an example.

```
from langchain.utils.math import cosine_similarity
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda, RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

physics_template = """You are a very smart physics professor. \
You are great at answering questions about physics in a concise and easy to understand manner. \
When you don't know the answer to a question you admit that you don't know.

Here is a question:
{query}"""

math_template = """You are a very good mathematician. You are great at answering math questions. \
You are so good because you are able to break down hard problems into their component parts, \
answer the component parts, and then put them together to answer the broader question.

Here is a question:
{query}"""

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
prompt_templates = [physics_template, math_template]
prompt_embeddings = embeddings.embed_documents(prompt_templates)


def prompt_router(input):
    query_embedding = embeddings.embed_query(input["query"])
    similarity = cosine_similarity([query_embedding], prompt_embeddings)[0]
    most_similar = prompt_templates[similarity.argmax()]
    print("Using MATH" if most_similar == math_template else "Using PHYSICS")
    return PromptTemplate.from_template(most_similar)


chain = (
    {"query": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | RunnableLambda(prompt_router)
    | ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
    | StrOutputParser()
)

```


```
print(chain.invoke("What's a black hole"))

```


```
Using PHYSICS
As a physics professor, I would be happy to provide a concise and easy-to-understand explanation of what a black hole is.

A black hole is an incredibly dense region of space-time where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. This means that if you were to get too close to a black hole, you would be pulled in and crushed by the intense gravitational forces.

The formation of a black hole occurs when a massive star, much larger than our Sun, reaches the end of its life and collapses in on itself. This collapse causes the matter to become extremely dense, and the gravitational force becomes so strong that it creates a point of no return, known as the event horizon.

Beyond the event horizon, the laws of physics as we know them break down, and the intense gravitational forces create a singularity, which is a point of infinite density and curvature in space-time.

Black holes are fascinating and mysterious objects, and there is still much to be learned about their properties and behavior. If I were unsure about any specific details or aspects of black holes, I would readily admit that I do not have a complete understanding and would encourage further research and investigation.

print(chain.invoke("What's a path integral"))

```


```
Using MATH
A path integral is a powerful mathematical concept in physics, particularly in the field of quantum mechanics. It was developed by the renowned physicist Richard Feynman as an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics.

In a path integral, instead of considering a single, definite path that a particle might take from one point to another, as in classical mechanics, the particle is considered to take all possible paths simultaneously. Each path is assigned a complex-valued weight, and the total probability amplitude for the particle to go from one point to another is calculated by summing (integrating) over all possible paths.

The key ideas behind the path integral formulation are:

1. Superposition principle: In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in a superposition of multiple states or paths simultaneously.

2. Probability amplitude: The probability amplitude for a particle to go from one point to another is calculated by summing the complex-valued weights of all possible paths.

3. Weighting of paths: Each path is assigned a weight based on the action (the time integral of the Lagrangian) along that path. Paths with lower action have a greater weight.

4. Feynman's approach: Feynman developed the path integral formulation as an alternative to the traditional wave function approach in quantum mechanics, providing a more intuitive and conceptual understanding of quantum phenomena.

The path integral approach is particularly useful in quantum field theory, where it provides a powerful framework for calculating transition probabilities and understanding the behavior of quantum systems. It has also found applications in various areas of physics, such as condensed matter, statistical mechanics, and even in finance (the path integral approach to option pricing).

The mathematical construction of the path integral involves the use of advanced concepts from functional analysis and measure theory, making it a powerful and sophisticated tool in the physicist's arsenal.
