Use case[‚Äã](#use-case "Direct link to Use case")
------------------------------------------------

Synthetic data is artificially generated data, rather than data collected from real-world events. It‚Äôs used to simulate real data without compromising privacy or encountering real-world limitations.

Benefits of Synthetic Data:

1.  **Privacy and Security**: No real personal data at risk of breaches.
2.  **Data Augmentation**: Expands datasets for machine learning.
3.  **Flexibility**: Create specific or rare scenarios.
4.  **Cost-effective**: Often cheaper than real-world data collection.
5.  **Regulatory Compliance**: Helps navigate strict data protection laws.
6.  **Model Robustness**: Can lead to better generalizing AI models.
7.  **Rapid Prototyping**: Enables quick testing without real data.
8.  **Controlled Experimentation**: Simulate specific conditions.
9.  **Access to Data**: Alternative when real data isn‚Äôt available.

Note: Despite the benefits, synthetic data should be used carefully, as it may not always capture real-world complexities.

Quickstart[‚Äã](#quickstart "Direct link to Quickstart")
------------------------------------------------------

In this notebook, we‚Äôll dive deep into generating synthetic medical billing records using the langchain library. This tool is particularly useful when you want to develop or test algorithms but don‚Äôt want to use real patient data due to privacy concerns or data availability issues.

### Setup[‚Äã](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

First, you‚Äôll need to have the langchain library installed, along with its dependencies. Since we‚Äôre using the OpenAI generator chain, we‚Äôll install that as well. Since this is an experimental lib, we‚Äôll need to include `langchain_experimental` in our installs. We‚Äôll then import the necessary modules.

```
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain_experimental langchain-openai
# Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file:
# import dotenv
# dotenv.load_dotenv()

from langchain_core.prompts import FewShotPromptTemplate, PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel
from langchain_experimental.tabular_synthetic_data.openai import (
    OPENAI_TEMPLATE,
    create_openai_data_generator,
)
from langchain_experimental.tabular_synthetic_data.prompts import (
    SYNTHETIC_FEW_SHOT_PREFIX,
    SYNTHETIC_FEW_SHOT_SUFFIX,
)
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

```


1\. Define Your Data Model[‚Äã](#define-your-data-model "Direct link to 1. Define Your Data Model")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every dataset has a structure or a ‚Äúschema‚Äù. The MedicalBilling class below serves as our schema for the synthetic data. By defining this, we‚Äôre informing our synthetic data generator about the shape and nature of data we expect.

```
class MedicalBilling(BaseModel):
    patient_id: int
    patient_name: str
    diagnosis_code: str
    procedure_code: str
    total_charge: float
    insurance_claim_amount: float

```


For instance, every record will have a `patient_id` that‚Äôs an integer, a `patient_name` that‚Äôs a string, and so on.

2\. Sample Data[‚Äã](#sample-data "Direct link to 2. Sample Data")
----------------------------------------------------------------

To guide the synthetic data generator, it‚Äôs useful to provide it with a few real-world-like examples. These examples serve as a ‚Äúseed‚Äù - they‚Äôre representative of the kind of data you want, and the generator will use them to create more data that looks similar.

Here are some fictional medical billing records:

```
examples = [
    {
        "example": """Patient ID: 123456, Patient Name: John Doe, Diagnosis Code: 
        J20.9, Procedure Code: 99203, Total Charge: $500, Insurance Claim Amount: $350"""
    },
    {
        "example": """Patient ID: 789012, Patient Name: Johnson Smith, Diagnosis 
        Code: M54.5, Procedure Code: 99213, Total Charge: $150, Insurance Claim Amount: $120"""
    },
    {
        "example": """Patient ID: 345678, Patient Name: Emily Stone, Diagnosis Code: 
        E11.9, Procedure Code: 99214, Total Charge: $300, Insurance Claim Amount: $250"""
    },
]

```


3\. Craft a Prompt Template[‚Äã](#craft-a-prompt-template "Direct link to 3. Craft a Prompt Template")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The generator doesn‚Äôt magically know how to create our data; we need to guide it. We do this by creating a prompt template. This template helps instruct the underlying language model on how to produce synthetic data in the desired format.

```
OPENAI_TEMPLATE = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["example"], template="{example}")

prompt_template = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    prefix=SYNTHETIC_FEW_SHOT_PREFIX,
    examples=examples,
    suffix=SYNTHETIC_FEW_SHOT_SUFFIX,
    input_variables=["subject", "extra"],
    example_prompt=OPENAI_TEMPLATE,
)

```


The `FewShotPromptTemplate` includes:

*   `prefix` and `suffix`: These likely contain guiding context or instructions.
*   `examples`: The sample data we defined earlier.
*   `input_variables`: These variables (‚Äúsubject‚Äù, ‚Äúextra‚Äù) are placeholders you can dynamically fill later. For instance, ‚Äúsubject‚Äù might be filled with ‚Äúmedical\_billing‚Äù to guide the model further.
*   `example_prompt`: This prompt template is the format we want each example row to take in our prompt.

4\. Creating the Data Generator[‚Äã](#creating-the-data-generator "Direct link to 4. Creating the Data Generator")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the schema and the prompt ready, the next step is to create the data generator. This object knows how to communicate with the underlying language model to get synthetic data.

```
synthetic_data_generator = create_openai_data_generator(
    output_schema=MedicalBilling,
    llm=ChatOpenAI(
        temperature=1
    ),  # You'll need to replace with your actual Language Model instance
    prompt=prompt_template,
)

```


5\. Generate Synthetic Data[‚Äã](#generate-synthetic-data "Direct link to 5. Generate Synthetic Data")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, let‚Äôs get our synthetic data!

```
synthetic_results = synthetic_data_generator.generate(
    subject="medical_billing",
    extra="the name must be chosen at random. Make it something you wouldn't normally choose.",
    runs=10,
)

```


This command asks the generator to produce 10 synthetic medical billing records. The results are stored in `synthetic_results`. The output will be a list of the MedicalBilling pydantic models.

### Other implementations[‚Äã](#other-implementations "Direct link to Other implementations")

        ],
        "preferences": {"minimum_length": 200, "style": "gossip"},
    }
)

```


```
{'fields': [{'actor': 'Tom Hanks', 'movies': ['Forrest Gump', 'Green Mile']},
  {'actor': 'Mads Mikkelsen', 'movies': ['Hannibal', 'Another round']}],
 'preferences': {'minimum_length': 200, 'style': 'gossip'},
 'text': 'Did you know that Tom Hanks, the beloved Hollywood actor known for his roles in "Forrest Gump" and "Green Mile", has shared the screen with the talented Mads Mikkelsen, who gained international acclaim for his performances in "Hannibal" and "Another round"?
