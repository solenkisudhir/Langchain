# Hypothetical Document Embeddings | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain
If we‚Äôre working with a similarity search-based index, like a vector store, then searching on raw questions may not work well because their embeddings may not be very similar to those of the relevant documents. Instead it might help to have the model generate a hypothetical relevant document, and then use that to perform similarity search. This is the key idea behind [Hypothetical Document Embedding, or HyDE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10496.pdf).

Let‚Äôs take a look at how we might perform search via hypothetical documents for our Q&A bot over the LangChain YouTube videos.

Setup[‚Äã](#setup "Direct link to Setup")
---------------------------------------

#### Install dependencies[‚Äã](#install-dependencies "Direct link to Install dependencies")

```
# %pip install -qU langchain langchain-openai

```


#### Set environment variables[‚Äã](#set-environment-variables "Direct link to Set environment variables")

We‚Äôll use OpenAI in this example:

```
import getpass
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()

# Optional, uncomment to trace runs with LangSmith. Sign up here: https://smith.langchain.com.
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()

```


Hypothetical document generation[‚Äã](#hypothetical-document-generation "Direct link to Hypothetical document generation")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ultimately generating a relevant hypothetical document reduces to trying to answer the user question. Since we‚Äôre desiging a Q&A bot for LangChain YouTube videos, we‚Äôll provide some basic context about LangChain and prompt the model to use a more pedantic style so that we get more realistic hypothetical documents:

```
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

system = """You are an expert about a set of software for building LLM-powered applications called LangChain, LangGraph, LangServe, and LangSmith.

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", system),
        ("human", "{question}"),
    ]
)
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", temperature=0)
qa_no_context = prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()

```


```
answer = qa_no_context.invoke(
    {
        "question": "how to use multi-modal models in a chain and turn chain into a rest api"
    }

```


```
To use multi-modal models in a chain and turn the chain into a REST API, you can leverage the capabilities of LangChain, LangGraph, and LangServe. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. **Building a Multi-Modal Model with LangChain**:
   - Start by defining your multi-modal model using LangChain. LangChain provides integrations with various deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers, making it easy to incorporate different modalities such as text, images, and audio.
   - You can create separate components for each modality and then combine them in a chain to build a multi-modal model.

2. **Building a Stateful, Multi-Actor Application with LangGraph**:
   - Once you have your multi-modal model defined in LangChain, you can use LangGraph to build a stateful, multi-actor application around it.
   - LangGraph allows you to define actors that interact with each other and maintain state, which is useful for handling multi-modal inputs and outputs in a chain.

3. **Deploying the Chain as a REST API with LangServe**:
   - After building your multi-modal model and application using LangChain and LangGraph, you can deploy the chain as a REST API using LangServe.
   - LangServe simplifies the process of exposing your LangChain application as a REST API, allowing you to easily interact with your multi-modal model through HTTP requests.

4. **Testing and Tracing with LangSmith**:
   - To ensure the reliability and performance of your multi-modal model and REST API, you can use LangSmith for testing and tracing.
   - LangSmith provides tools for tracing the execution of your LLM applications and running tests to validate their functionality.

By following these steps and leveraging the capabilities of LangChain, LangGraph, LangServe, and LangSmith, you can effectively use multi-modal models in a chain and turn the chain into a REST API.

Returning the hypothetical document and original question[‚Äã](#returning-the-hypothetical-document-and-original-question "Direct link to Returning the hypothetical document and original question")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To increase our recall we may want to retrieve documents based on both the hypothetical document and the original question. We can easily return both like so:

```
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

hyde_chain = RunnablePassthrough.assign(hypothetical_document=qa_no_context)

hyde_chain.invoke(
    {
        "question": "how to use multi-modal models in a chain and turn chain into a rest api"
    }
)

```


```

LangServe simplifies the process of exposing your LangChain application as a web service, making it accessible to other applications and users.\n\n5. **Test and trace your application using LangSmith**: Finally, you can use LangSmith to trace and test your multi-modal LLM application. LangSmith provides tools for monitoring the performance of your application, debugging any issues, and ensuring that it functions as expected.\n\nBy following these steps and leveraging the capabilities of LangChain, LangGraph, LangServe, and LangSmith, you can effectively use multi-modal models in a chain and turn the chain into a REST API."}

Using function-calling to get structured output[‚Äã](#using-function-calling-to-get-structured-output "Direct link to Using function-calling to get structured output")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we were composing this technique with other query analysis techniques, we‚Äôd likely be using function calling to get out structured query objects. We can use function-calling for HyDE like so:

```
from langchain_core.output_parsers.openai_tools import PydanticToolsParser
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field


class Query(BaseModel):
    answer: str = Field(
        ...,

    )
