# Message Memory in Agent backed by a database | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain
This notebook goes over adding memory to an Agent where the memory uses an external message store. Before going through this notebook, please walkthrough the following notebooks, as this will build on top of both of them:

*   [Memory in LLMChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/memory/adding_memory/)
*   [Custom Agents](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent/)
*   [Memory in Agent](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/memory/agent_with_memory/)

In order to add a memory with an external message store to an agent we are going to do the following steps:

1.  We are going to create a `RedisChatMessageHistory` to connect to an external database to store the messages in.
2.  We are going to create an `LLMChain` using that chat history as memory.
3.  We are going to use that `LLMChain` to create a custom Agent.

For the purposes of this exercise, we are going to create a simple custom Agent that has access to a search tool and utilizes the `ConversationBufferMemory` class.

```
import os

from langchain import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, Tool
from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import RedisChatMessageHistory
from langchain_community.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

```


```
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "GOOGLE_API_KEY"
os.environ["GOOGLE_CSE_ID"] = "GOOGLE_CSE_ID"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "OPENAI_API_KEY"

search = SerpAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events",
    )
]

```


Notice the usage of the `chat_history` variable in the `PromptTemplate`, which matches up with the dynamic key name in the `ConversationBufferMemory`.

```
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react")

```


Now we can create the `RedisChatMessageHistory` backed by the database.

```
message_history = RedisChatMessageHistory(
    url="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0", ttl=600, session_id="my-session"
)

```


We can now construct the `LLMChain`, with the Memory object, and then create the agent.

```
from langchain.agents import create_react_agent

model = OpenAI()
agent = create_react_agent(model, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

```


```
agent_with_chat_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
    agent_executor,
    # This is needed because in most real world scenarios, a session id is needed
    # It isn't really used here because we are using a simple in memory ChatMessageHistory
    lambda session_id: message_history,
    input_messages_key="input",
    history_messages_key="chat_history",
)

agent_with_chat_history.invoke(
    {"input": "How many people live in canada?"},
    config={"configurable": {"session_id": "<foo>"}},
)

```


```

 I should use the Search tool to find the latest population data for Canada.
Action: Search
Action Input: "population of canada"{'type': 'population_result', 'place': 'Canada', 'population': '38.93 million', 'year': '2022'}I now know the final answer
Final Answer: The final answer to the original input question is 38.93 million people live in Canada as of 2022.

> Finished chain.

```


```
{'input': 'How many people live in canada?',
 'chat_history': [],
 'output': 'The final answer to the original input question is 38.93 million people live in Canada as of 2022.'}

```


To test the memory of this agent, we can ask a followup question that relies on information in the previous exchange to be answered correctly.

```
agent_with_chat_history.invoke(
    {"input": "what is their national anthem called?"},
    config={"configurable": {"session_id": "<foo>"}},
)

```


```

Final Answer: The final answer cannot be determined without specifying which country's national anthem is being referred to.

{'input': 'what is their national anthem called?',
 'chat_history': [HumanMessage(content='How many people live in canada?'),
  AIMessage(content='The final answer to the original input question is 38.93 million people live in Canada as of 2022.')],
 'output': "The final answer cannot be determined without specifying which country's national anthem is being referred to."}

```


We can see that the agent remembered that the previous question was about Canada, and properly asked Google Search what the name of Canada‚Äôs national anthem was.

For fun, let‚Äôs compare this to an agent that does NOT have memory.

```
agent = create_react_agent(model, tools, prompt)
agent_executor__without_memory = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

```


```
agent_executor__without_memory.invoke({"input": "How many people live in canada?"})

```
