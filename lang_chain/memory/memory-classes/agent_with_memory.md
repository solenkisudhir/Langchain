# Memory in Agent | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain
This notebook goes over adding memory to an Agent. Before going through this notebook, please walkthrough the following notebooks, as this will build on top of both of them:

*   [Memory in LLMChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/memory/adding_memory/)
*   [Custom Agents](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent/)

In order to add a memory to an agent we are going to perform the following steps:

1.  We are going to create an `LLMChain` with memory.
2.  We are going to use that `LLMChain` to create a custom Agent.

For the purposes of this exercise, we are going to create a simple custom Agent that has access to a search tool and utilizes the `ConversationBufferMemory` class.

```
import os

from langchain.agents import Tool
from langchain_community.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper

```


```
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "GOOGLE_API_KEY"
os.environ["GOOGLE_CSE_ID"] = "GOOGLE_CSE_ID"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events",
    )
]

```


Notice the usage of the `chat_history` variable in the `PromptTemplate`, which matches up with the dynamic key name in the `ConversationBufferMemory`.

```
from langchain import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_react_agent
from langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistory

prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react")

memory = ChatMessageHistory(session_id="test-session")

```


```
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)

agent_with_chat_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
    agent_executor,
    # This is needed because in most real world scenarios, a session id is needed
    # It isn't really used here because we are using a simple in memory ChatMessageHistory
    lambda session_id: memory,
    input_messages_key="input",
    history_messages_key="chat_history",
)

```


```
agent_with_chat_history.invoke(
    {"input": "How many people live in canada?"},
    config={"configurable": {"session_id": "<foo>"}},
)

```


```

Action: Search
Action Input: "population of Canada"{'type': 'population_result', 'place': 'Canada', 'population': '38.93 million', 'year': '2022'}38.93 million people live in Canada as of 2022.
Final Answer: 38.93 million

> Finished chain.

```


```
{'input': 'How many people live in canada?',
 'chat_history': [],
 'output': '38.93 million'}

```


To test the memory of this agent, we can ask a followup question that relies on information in the previous exchange to be answered correctly.

```
agent_with_chat_history.invoke(
    {"input": "what is their national anthem called?"},
    config={"configurable": {"session_id": "<foo>"}},
)

```


```

```
{'input': 'what is their national anthem called?',
 'chat_history': [HumanMessage(content='How many people live in canada?'),
  AIMessage(content='38.93 million')],
 'output': 'The national anthem of a country can be found by searching for the country\'s name and "national anthem".'}

```


We can see that the agent remembered that the previous question was about Canada, and properly asked Google Search what the name of Canada‚Äôs national anthem was.

For fun, let‚Äôs compare this to an agent that does NOT have memory.

```
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor_without_memory = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)

```


```
agent_executor_without_memory.invoke({"input": "How many people live in canada?"})

```


```

Action Input: "population of Canada source"The 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure. It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40 million in 2023 and 41 million in 2024. I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: The estimated population of Canada in 2022 is 38.93 million.
