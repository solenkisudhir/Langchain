# Select by n-gram overlap | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain
The `NGramOverlapExampleSelector` selects and orders examples based on which examples are most similar to the input, according to an ngram overlap score. The ngram overlap score is a float between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.

The selector allows for a threshold score to be set. Examples with an ngram overlap score less than or equal to the threshold are excluded. The threshold is set to -1.0, by default, so will not exclude any examples, only reorder them. Setting the threshold to 0.0 will exclude examples that have no ngram overlaps with the input.
